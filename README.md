# WesternAstrologyJS

This project exists with the intention to make western astrological horoscope creation free, readily available, and easy to access for anyone who can interact with Javascript. By horoscope, we're talking about astrological & birth charts. Not daily predictions (although you are certainly free to make them with these charts).

Example:

![Natal Chart Example](public/natal-chart.svg)

The goal is to allow someone to:

1) Enter a date + time and

2) Enter latitude/longitude coordinates for a position on the planet Earth

Then receive:

  => the ephemeris for all major bodies (`Sun`, `Moon`, `Mercury`, `Venus`, `Mars`, `Jupiter`, `Saturn`, `Uranus`, `Neptune`, `Pluto`!!)

  => the cusps of each astrological sign as it relates to the ecliptic plane (`Aries`, `Taurus`, `Gemini`, `Cancer`, `Leo`, `Virgo`, `Libra`, `Scorpio`, `Sagittarius`, `Capricorn`, `Aquarius`, `Pisces`)

  => the cusps of each house within the Placidus house system as it relates to the ecliptic plane (more house systems to come, possibly).

  => the constellation position for each major body

  => the house position for each major body
