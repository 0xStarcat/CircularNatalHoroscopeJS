# Circular Natal Horoscope JS

By **horoscope**, we're talking about the astrological **birth charts**. **Not** horoscope readings or interpretations.

I'm hoping to avoid commonly used labels like "Western" or "Hellenistic", but these are very much the circular charts you see in eur-asian based astrology traditions and not the charts in Chinese or Vedic traditions.

Example Chart:

![Natal Chart Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xStarcat/CircularNatalHoroscopeJS/master/public/natal-chart.svg)

The goal is to provide a library which will allow someone to:

1. Enter a calendar date + time and latitude/longitude coordinates for a position on the planet Earth.

2. And receive Javascript results which can be used to interface with a separate frontend library (maybe this one https://github.com/Kibo/AstroChart or a custom one) for creating the actual charts.

This package now works with typescript projects!

## Current Features

Given a date/time/point of origin...

1. Allows user to switch between Tropical and Sidereal zodiacs when constructing calculations.
2. Calculates the major angles (`ascendant` and `Midheaven (MC)`) in relation to the point of origin
3. Calculates the positions for all major bodies (`Sun`, `Moon`, `Mercury`, `Venus`, `Mars`, `Jupiter`, `Saturn`, `Uranus`, `Neptune`, `Pluto`) in relation to the point of origin
4. Calculates the positions of the north/south Lunar Nodes and Lilith in relation to the point of origin
5. Notes whether a planet is in retrograde at the given date/time
6. Provides the cusps of each house in relation to the point of origin within multiple house systems.~~ (Placidus, Koch, Topocentric, Regiomontanus, Campanus, Whole Sign, and Equal House added.)
7. Provides the cusps of each astrological sign in relation to the point of origin
8. Provides a configurable list containing all the computed major and minor aspects of all bodies / points / angles
9. Provides a way to extend this library with other language and deliver language-specific labels and names within the results.

## Future work

=> Positions of the lots (Fortune, Spirit, Eros, etc)

=> I'm open to requests for house systems. I'm currently stopped at 6 - we have 2 "modern" systems (Topocentric, Koch), 3 "medieval" systems (Placidus, Regiomontanus, Campanus), and 2 "ancient" systems (Whole Sign, Equal House). My formula resource "An Astrological House Formulary" by Michael P. Munkasey has many more house formulas I can implement if wanted. Hopefully I covered the most popular ones.

## Implementation / Use

1. Get the Origin

```js
import { Origin, Horoscope } from "circular-natal-horoscope-js";

//////////
// Origin
//////////
// This class automatically derives the local timezone from latitude/longitude coordinates
// and calculates UTC time with respect to timezone and historical daylight savings time.
// Only works for C.E. date (> 0).
/////////
// * int year: value >= 0 C.E.
// * int month: (0 = january ...11 = december)
// * int date: (1...31)
// * int hours = local time - hours value (0...23)
// * int minute = local time - minute value (0...59)
// * float latitude = latitude in decimal format (-90.00...90.00)
// * float longitude = longitude in decimal format (-180.00...180.00)

// December 1st, 2020 - 430pm
const origin = new Origin({
  year: 2020,
  month: 11, // 0 = January, 11 = December!
  date: 1,
  hour: 16,
  minute: 30,
  latitude: 40.0,
  longitude: -70.0,
});
```

2. Configure your horoscope results

```js
import { Origin, Horoscope } from "circular-natal-horoscope-js";

//////////
// Horoscope
//////////
// This class contains horoscope chart calculations
/////////
// * Origin origin: instance of the Origin class
// * string houseSystem: one of the following: ['placidus', 'koch', 'campanus', 'whole-sign', 'equal-house', 'regiomontanus', 'topocentric'] - full list validated in self.HouseSystems
// * string zodiac: one of the following: ['sidereal', 'tropical'] - full list validated self.ZodiacSystems
// * array aspectPoints = an array containing all or none of the strings "bodies", "points", or "angles" to determine which starting points will be used in aspect generation
// * array aspectWithPoints = an array containing all or none of the strings "bodies", "points", or "angles" to determine ending points will be used in aspect generation
// * array aspectTypes = an array containing all or none of the following: "major", "minor", "conjunction", "opposition", etc to determine which aspects to calculate.
// * object customOrbs = an object with specific keys set to override the default orbs and set your own for aspect calculation.
// * string language = the language code (en, es, etc) which will return labels and results in a specific language, if configured.
//
// *NOTE: "bodies" = planets, "points" = lunar nodes / lilith, "angles" = ascendant / midheaven
// *NOTE: You can also pass in individual bodies, points, or angles into aspectPoints or aspectWithPoints
// * example: { aspectPoints: ["sun"], aspectWithPoints: ["moon"], aspectTypes: ["major", "quincunx"] }
// * will only calculate sun to moon major or quincunx aspects if they exist
// * All usable keys found in ./src/constant.js under BODIES, POINTS, ANGLES


const horoscope = new Horoscope({
      origin: new Origin({...}),
      houseSystem: "whole-sign",
      zodiac: "tropical",
      aspectPoints: ['bodies', 'points', 'angles'],
      aspectWithPoints: ['bodies', 'points', 'angles'],
      aspectTypes: ["major", "minor"],
      customOrbs: {},
      language: 'en'
    });

```

2b. (optional) Set custom orb degrees for aspects. Default orbs are found in `./src/constants.js`

```js
import { Origin, Horoscope } from "circular-natal-horoscope-js";


const customOrbs = {
      conjunction: 8,
      opposition: 8,
      trine: 8,
      square: 7,
      sextile: 6,
      quincunx: 5,
      quintile: 1,
      septile: 1,
      "semi-square": 1,
      "semi-sextile": 1,
    };


const horoscope = new Horoscope({
      origin: new Origin({...}),
      houseSystem: "whole-sign",
      zodiac: "tropical",
      aspectPoints: ['bodies', 'points', 'angles'],
      aspectWithPoints: ['bodies', 'points', 'angles'],
      aspectTypes: ["major", "minor"],
      customOrbs: customOrbs,
      language: 'en'
    });

```

3. Get your results

```js
import { Origin, Horoscope } from "circular-natal-horoscope-js";


const horoscope = new Horoscope({...})


// Info for all critical angles
horoscope.Angles = {
  all: [...],
  ascendant: {...},
  midheaven: {...}
}

// The ascendant info
horoscope.Ascendant = {...}

// Aspect results
horoscope.Aspects = {
  all: [...],
  points: {
    // organized by point
    ascendant: [...], // etc
    sun: [...], // etc
    moon: [...], // etc
  },
  types: {
    // organized by type
    conjunction: [...], // etc
    opposition: [...] // etc
  }
}

// Planet / Asteriod results
// sun, moon, mercury, venus, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune, pluto, chiron, sirius
horoscope.CelestialBodies = {
  all: [...],
  sun: {...}, // etc
  moon: {...} // etc
}

// lunar results
// northnode, southnode, lilith
horoscope.CelestialPoints = {
  all: [...],
  northnode: {...}, //etc
}

// house cusps
horoscope.Houses = [
  ...12
]

// Midheaven info

horoscope.Midheaven = {
  ...
}

// Info about what zodiac sign the sun is in at a given origin
horoscope.SunSign = {
  ...
}

// Info about the zodiac cusps at the given date/time/location origin
horoscope.ZodiacCusps = [
  ...12
]

```

##### Interpreting ChartPositions:

You'll frequently see a `ChartPosition` class in your results for house cusps, zodiac cusps, bodies, etc. This class should give you everything you need to orient and place the cusp / body onto your circular natal chart. It provides a set of points for the object to place it along the `horizon` or the `ecliptic`.

The `horizon` is typically understood to be the inner circle on the natal chart. The `Ascendant` is commonly located at `0 degrees` along the horizon circle.

The `ecliptic` is understood to be the outer circle on the natal chart. The start of `Aries` is always at `0 degrees` along this circle.

```js
const mercury = {
  ...,
  // ChartPosition for a mercury in Libra and conjunct the ascendant.
  ChartPosition: {
    Horizon: { // mercury is on the horizon mercury the ascendant (0 deg horizon)
      ArcDegrees: {degrees: 0, minutes: 0, seconds: 0}
      ArcDegreesFormatted: "0째 0' 0''"
      ArcDegreesFormatted30: "0째 0' 0''"
      DecimalDegrees: 0
    },
    Ecliptic: { // mercury is also at 180 degrees on the ecliptic, so within Libra sign.
      ArcDegrees: {degrees: 180, minutes: 38, seconds: 2}
      ArcDegreesFormatted: "180째 38' 2''"
      ArcDegreesFormatted30: "0째 38' 2''"
      DecimalDegrees: 180.634
    }
  }
}

```

## Installation

If installing from source, clone this repo load the main file found at `dist/index.js`.

This package is also hosted on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/circular-natal-horoscope-js)

Install it with:

```
npm i circular-natal-horoscope-js --save

// or yarn

yarn add circular-natal-horoscope-js
```

## Development

Install node modules

```
npm install

// or

yarn install
```

Then run

```

yarn start:dev
```

and any changes you make should be reflected in `dist/demo.html` if you open the file in a browser.

Run tests with

```
npm test

// or

yarn test
```

## Building

This package uses webpack to produce a javascript bundle. If modifying this code, a new bundle can be built with the following command:

```
npm run build

// or

yarn run build
```

## Demo

A small HTML implementation demo is provided.

To view, build the demo files locally with:

`npm run build:demo`

and then open `demo/dist/demo.html` in a browser.

Please Note: The demo chart is just used as an visual example of what the library can do and isnt part of the core library. The chart uses code from this repo: [https://github.com/Kibo/AstroChart](https://github.com/Kibo/AstroChart).

## Adding new languages

You can see how English and Spanish tokens are implemented in `src/utilities/language.js`. Copy the tokens for 1 language and add it to a key matching the ISO language code you want. Then, when you generate the horoscope, pass this code into the constructor:

```js
new Horoscope({ language: "es" });
```

and your language will appear in the results under the `.label` keys supplied within `Sign`, `Aspect`, `Planet`, `House` objects.

## Publishing / Packaging

I recommend doing a github release first and then testing this package locally before publishing to npm!
You can test a package from a github release by adding the following to any project dependencies:

```
"git+https://github.com/0xStarcat/CircularNatalHoroscopeJS.git#<tag or commit>"
```

- update the version number in `package.json`
- Build with `npm run build` and commit to branch
- run `npm publish`
